Letâ€™s build your Flutter APK step by step.

ğŸŸ¢ Step 1: Make sure everything is ready

In your Flutter project root, run:

flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter doctor


ğŸ‘‰ Fix any errors shown by flutter doctor (especially Android SDK / Java).

ğŸŸ¢ Step 2: Build a debug APK (quick test)
flutter build apk --debug


This will generate a debug APK (not optimized, but quick to install).

ğŸ“‚ Location:

build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk

ğŸŸ¢ Step 3: Build a release APK (for publishing / sharing)
flutter build apk --release


ğŸ“‚ Location:

build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk


âš¡ This APK is optimized, but you need signing if you want to upload it to Play Store.

ğŸŸ¢ Step 4: Optional â€“ Split per architecture (smaller APKs)
flutter build apk --split-per-abi


ğŸ“‚ Output:

build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-arm64-v8a-release.apk
build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk
build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-x86_64-release.apk


ğŸ‘‰ These APKs are smaller and optimized for specific devices.

ğŸŸ¢ Step 5: Install APK on your device

Use adb (make sure your phone is connected and USB debugging enabled):

adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk


âœ… Done! Now you have your APK.
